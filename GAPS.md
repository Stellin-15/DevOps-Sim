# GAPS.md — will kube-sim actually prepare you for the CKA and real production incidents?

Honest self-assessment, written from the perspective of a beginner using
this game as their main prep tool for (a) passing the CKA exam and (b)
eventually handling production Kubernetes incidents on their own. Short
answer: **helpful, not sufficient, for both** — and this file exists to be
specific about where it falls short, so nobody mistakes "completed every
scenario" for "ready."

**Scope note:** this assessment covers the **Kubernetes** category only.
The game has since expanded to Docker, Linux, Terraform, Networking,
CI/CD, Monitoring, and MLOps too (see README.md/CLAUDE.md) — those
categories are at an earlier content-depth stage and haven't had an
equivalent gap analysis yet. Everything below is specifically about
whether the Kubernetes content (tutorials 001-029, incidents 001-010,
YAML labs) holds up against real CKA/production expectations.

---

## What kube-sim is actually good at

- **Command muscle memory.** By tutorial-020 you've typed real kubectl
  syntax — verbs, resources, flags, short aliases — for almost everything
  an application developer touches day to day.
- **The "why," not just the "what."** Every tutorial step explains why
  that command/flag beat the alternatives, which is closer to how an
  experienced engineer actually thinks than rote syntax memorization.
- **Investigative sequencing.** Incidents force chaining get → describe →
  logs → fix, which is the actual shape of real debugging — most
  beginners' instinct is to guess a fix immediately instead.
- **A safe place to be wrong.** Hint escalation and Sandbox mode mean you
  can flail without consequence, which real clusters (and real on-call
  shifts) do not offer.

## Where it falls short for the CKA specifically

The CKA is roughly 30% troubleshooting, but also has entire domains
kube-sim doesn't touch at all, because they require actions below the
kubectl layer that a pure command-matching game can't meaningfully verify:

| CKA domain (approx. weight) | kube-sim coverage | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Troubleshooting (~30%) | Good for app-layer (pods, services, resources) | Weak on control-plane/node-layer troubleshooting until this update |
| Workloads & Scheduling (~15%) | Strong (deployments, jobs, scaling, scheduling) | Was missing probes and multi-container pods until this update |
| Services & Networking (~20%) | Decent (services, ingress, netpol, DNS objects) | Was missing DNS *failure* debugging (CoreDNS) until this update |
| Storage (~10%) | Basic (PV/PVC/StorageClass get/describe) | No dynamic provisioning failure scenarios, no volume mount troubleshooting |
| Cluster Architecture & Installation (~25%) | Was essentially absent | kubeadm bootstrap/upgrade, static pods, etcd backup/restore, certificate management — this is the single biggest gap, and this update addresses the highest-value pieces of it |

**Update — largely addressed.** This used to be a structural gap nothing
in kube-sim could fix: the CKA is a hands-on exam where you write and edit
YAML under time pressure, and a pure command-matching game can't simulate
that. It's now addressed by **YAML Labs**, a third mode alongside
Learn/Incidents: the game writes a real file to `workspace/`, tells you
what to build or fix, and you edit it in your *actual* editor (vim, nano,
VS Code — whatever you'd really use) — the same muscle the exam tests,
not a simulated one. Typing the apply command reads your real file off
disk, parses it, and gives field-by-field feedback (missing field, wrong
value, YAML syntax error), with the same nudge → hint → full-solution-
reveal escalation as everywhere else. See `yaml_lab.py` and
`scenarios/yaml_labs/`.

What YAML Labs still doesn't replicate: real exam **time pressure**
(there's no clock here), the breadth of an actual live cluster (no real
apiserver validating your YAML beyond what each lab's `validate` spec
checks), and the physical friction of working across multiple terminal
panes/contexts at once. Time on a real kind/minikube cluster remains
worthwhile before the actual exam — but "structurally impossible to
practice YAML editing here at all" is no longer true.

## Where it falls short for real production incidents

A few things that matter in practice and aren't really "exam topics" at
all, so they're easy to skip even after CKA-level prep:

- **Silent failure modes.** incident-009 (HPA stuck because metrics-server
  was never installed) is the shape of a huge share of real incidents:
  nothing is *broken*, something was just never wired up, and it looks
  fine until load reveals it. These don't show up in describe/get output
  as an obvious red error — you have to know to check.
- **Cascading/compounding failures.** incident-007 (readiness probe
  flapping under load makes the load worse) is closer to a real incident
  than a single root cause — most production fires have a feedback loop,
  not one clean cause.
- **When kubectl itself is the thing that's broken.** tutorial-024 covers
  this, but it's a mindset shift beginners often miss: sometimes the tool
  you'd normally debug with is unavailable, and you need a completely
  different toolset (journalctl, static pod manifests, node filesystem).
- **Judgment about risk**, not just correct syntax — e.g. incident-010's
  resolution deliberately flags that force-deleting a pod is only safe
  once you've independently confirmed the node is truly dead, not just
  unresponsive. A game can explain this in a resolution debrief; it can't
  fully substitute for the instinct that comes from having been burned by
  it once.
- **Escalation and communication** aren't practiced here at all — a huge
  part of real incident response is knowing when to page someone else,
  what to say in a status update, and how to hand off. Out of scope for
  this tool, but worth knowing it's out of scope.

## What this update adds to close the highest-value gaps

Given the assessment above, this pass adds:

**Tutorials** (021–029): liveness/readiness/startup probes, multi-container
& init containers, etcd backup & restore, static pods & control-plane
troubleshooting, kubeadm cluster upgrades, certificate management, cluster
& pod security (security contexts, Pod Security Standards), kubeadm
cluster bootstrap (init/join/token), and Operators & custom controllers
(the reconciliation-loop pattern, building on tutorial-018's CRDs) —
covering the Cluster Architecture domain that was previously almost
entirely absent, plus the probes/multi-container/security gaps in
Workloads and cluster security.

**Explicitly out of scope: Kubeflow.** It's an ML platform (pipelines,
notebooks, training jobs) that happens to run *on* Kubernetes, not a core
Kubernetes/CKA skill — closer to "an application you'd deploy" than "how
the cluster works." It's not on the CKA, and faking realistic Kubeflow
output here would teach a false sense of familiarity with a genuinely
large, separate ecosystem. If that's the actual goal, it needs its own
dedicated resource, not a few kube-sim tutorials.

**Incidents** (006–010): ImagePullBackOff, a readiness-probe cascading
failure, a CoreDNS outage, a silently-nonfunctional HPA (missing
metrics-server), and a NotReady node requiring node-filesystem-level
debugging — chosen specifically because they're either extremely common
in real production (ImagePullBackOff, probe misconfiguration) or teach a
failure mode beginners don't know to look for (silent failures, control
plane being the actual outage).

## What's still not covered (backlog, not addressed this pass)

- Dynamic storage provisioning failures, volume mount troubleshooting
- RBAC-denial as an *incident* (tutorial-012 teaches the commands, but
  there's no investigative incident built around "why can't this pod do X")
- PodDisruptionBudget blocking a drain
- Admission controllers / webhooks
- More YAML Labs — only 5 exist (pod-from-scratch, broken-deployment-fix,
  multi-container/init, NetworkPolicy, PVC); StatefulSet, Ingress, HPA,
  and RBAC (Role/RoleBinding) manifests would be natural next labs
- Kubeflow and other on-top-of-Kubernetes application platforms —
  deliberately out of scope, see above

*Written honestly, not to make the tool look complete. If you're using
this for CKA prep: also get time on a real cluster (kind/minikube) before
the exam, especially for YAML-writing speed. If you're using it to build
toward handling production on your own: pair it with actually being on an
on-call rotation, shadowed, before being the primary responder.*
